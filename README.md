## About This Portfolio

I built this portfolio to demonstrate my ability to craft responsive and interactive web applications using modern technologies. My primary goal was to create a platform that not only displays my work but also reflects my commitment to writing clean, maintainable code and understanding user experience principles.

Key objectives included:

-   Implementing a scalable component-based architecture.
-   Utilising TypeScript for type safety and code robustness.
-   Designing a responsive layout that works seamlessly across devices.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**

-   **Next.js 14**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
-   **React**: Library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: Static typing for enhanced development reliability.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
-   **Framer Motion**: Library for performant and complex animations.
-   **shadcn/ui**: Reusable component collection built on Radix UI.

**Backend & Tools**

-   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
-   **Git & GitHub**: Version control and source code management.
-   **Vercel**: Platform for deployment and hosting.

## Key Features

-   **Responsive Design**: distinct layouts optimised for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
-   **Component Architecture**: Modular and reusable component structure for easier maintenance.
-   **Performance Optimised**: Leverages Next.js features like efficient image loading and code splitting.
-   **Interactive UI**: Smooth transitions and scroll-driven animations using Framer Motion.
-   **Dark Mode**: Native support for light and dark color schemes.
